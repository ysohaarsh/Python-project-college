# Restaurant Management System (College Python Project)

This Restaurant Management System is a Python-based application with a graphical user interface (GUI) created using the tkinter module. The project was developed as part of a college assignment and is inspired by the New Boston tutorials, with additional tabs and functionalities added for enhanced usability.

## Project Overview

The Restaurant Management System allows users to perform various tasks related to restaurant operations, including:

- Calculating the total cost of meals and drinks.
- Displaying a price list of menu items.
- Generating random order numbers.
- Resetting and exiting the application.

The project code consists of several components:

- **Main Application (main.py):** This is the main Python script that initializes the tkinter GUI, sets the theme, and handles the functionality of the Restaurant Management System.

- **Calculator Functionality:** The application includes a calculator widget that allows users to perform calculations related to meal costs.

- **Order Details:** Users can input quantities of different menu items, and the application calculates the subtotal, tax, service charge, and total cost.

- **Price List:** There's an option to view the price list of menu items.
